"AKT3 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) called the AKT kinase, and which regulate many processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth and angiogenesis. This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates. Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported. AKT3 is the least studied AKT isoform. It plays an important role in brain development and is crucial for the viability of malignant glioma cells. AKT3 isoform may also be the key molecule in up-regulation and down-regulation of MMP13 via IL13. Required for the coordination of mitochondrial biogenesis with growth factor-induced increases in cellular energy demands. Down-regulation by RNA interference reduces the expression of the phosphorylated form of BAD, resulting in the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis.",10000,AKT3,"N-((S)-1-amino-3-(3-fluorophenyl)propan-2-yl)-4-bromo-5-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-4-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamide (0.002 uM); 4-(2-(4-amino-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1-ethyl-6-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-4-yl)-2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol (0.022 uM); N-[6-[[(2R)-6-amino-1-[[6-[[(2R)-1-[[(2R)-1-amino-5-(diaminomethylideneamino)-1-oxopentan-2-yl]amino]-5-(diaminomethylideneamino)-1-oxopentan-2-yl]amino]-6-oxohexyl]amino]-1-oxohexan-2-yl]amino]-6-oxohexyl]-3-pyridin-4-ylbenzamide (0.9 uM); 1-(2,4-Dichlorobenzyl)-3-(5-(2-(methylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)urea (2.1 uM); (2S)-methyl 3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(2-(2-(methylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl)thiophene-5-carboxamido)propanoate (2.4 uM)","2X18, 8ZXW",RAC-gamma serine/threonine-protein kinase,"Endosomal/lysosomal proton channel TMEM175, Heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha, Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha isoform, RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, TNF receptor-associated factor 6",Q9Y243,hsa:10000,"[{'cid': '44592504', 'name': 'N-((S)-1-amino-3-(3-fluorophenyl)propan-2-yl)-4-bromo-5-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-4-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamide', 'potency_um': 0.002}, {'cid': '11959377', 'name': '4-(2-(4-amino-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1-ethyl-6-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-4-yl)-2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol', 'potency_um': 0.022}, {'cid': '46882134', 'name': 'N-[6-[[(2R)-6-amino-1-[[6-[[(2R)-1-[[(2R)-1-amino-5-(diaminomethylideneamino)-1-oxopentan-2-yl]amino]-5-(diaminomethylideneamino)-1-oxopentan-2-yl]amino]-6-oxohexyl]amino]-1-oxohexan-2-yl]amino]-6-oxohexyl]-3-pyridin-4-ylbenzamide', 'potency_um': 0.9}, {'cid': '44414652', 'name': '1-(2,4-Dichlorobenzyl)-3-(5-(2-(methylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)urea', 'potency_um': 2.1}, {'cid': '44414553', 'name': '(2S)-methyl 3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(2-(2-(methylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl)thiophene-5-carboxamido)propanoate', 'potency_um': 2.4}]"

"Proline-directed serine/threonine-protein kinase essential for neuronal cell cycle arrest and differentiation and may be involved in apoptotic cell death in neuronal diseases by triggering abortive cell cycle re-entry. Interacts with D1 and D3-type G1 cyclins. Phosphorylates SRC, NOS3, VIM/vimentin, p35/CDK5R1, MEF2A, SIPA1L1, SH3GLB1, PXN, PAK1, MCAM/MUC18, SEPT5, SYN1, DNM1, AMPH, SYNJ1, CDK16, RAC1, RHOA, CDC42, TONEBP/NFAT5, MAPT/TAU, MAP1B, histone H1, p53/TP53, HDAC1, APEX1, PTK2/FAK1, huntingtin/HTT, ATM, MAP2, NEFH and NEFM. Regulates several neuronal development and physiological processes including neuronal survival, migration and differentiation, axonal and neurite growth, synaptogenesis, oligodendrocyte differentiation, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission, by phosphorylating key proteins. Negatively regulates the CACNA1B/CAV2.2 -mediated Ca(2+) release probability at hippocampal neuronal soma and synaptic terminals (By similarity). Activated by interaction with CDK5R1 (p35) and CDK5R2 (p39), especially in postmitotic neurons, and promotes CDK5R1 (p35) expression in an autostimulation loop. Phosphorylates many downstream substrates such as Rho and Ras family small GTPases (e.g. PAK1, RAC1, RHOA, CDC42) or microtubule-binding proteins (e.g. MAPT/TAU, MAP2, MAP1B), and modulates actin dynamics to regulate neurite growth and/or spine morphogenesis. Also phosphorylates exocytosis associated proteins such as MCAM/MUC18, SEPT5, SYN1, and CDK16/PCTAIRE1 as well as endocytosis associated proteins such as DNM1, AMPH and SYNJ1 at synaptic terminals. In the mature central nervous system (CNS), regulates neurotransmitter movements by phosphorylating substrates associated with neurotransmitter release and synapse plasticity; synaptic vesicle exocytosis, vesicles fusion with the presynaptic membrane, and endocytosis. Promotes cell survival by activating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and STAT3, and negatively regulating of JNK3/MAPK10 activity. Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 in response to genotoxic and oxidative stresses enhances its stabilization by preventing ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation, and induces transactivation of p53/TP53 target genes, thus regulating apoptosis. Phosphorylation of p35/CDK5R1 enhances its stabilization by preventing calpain-mediated proteolysis producing p25/CDK5R1 and avoiding ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation. During aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage, p25/CDK5 activity elicits cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that precedes neuronal death by deregulating HDAC1. DNA damage triggered phosphorylation of huntingtin/HTT in nuclei of neurons protects neurons against polyglutamine expansion as well as DNA damage mediated toxicity. Phosphorylation of PXN reduces its interaction with PTK2/FAK1 in matrix-cell focal adhesions (MCFA) during oligodendrocytes (OLs) differentiation. Negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Activator of the GAIT (IFN-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) pathway, which suppresses expression of a post-transcriptional regulon of proinflammatory genes in myeloid cells; phosphorylates the linker domain of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) in a IFN-gamma-dependent manner, the initial event in assembly of the GAIT complex. Phosphorylation of SH3GLB1 is required for autophagy induction in starved neurons. Phosphorylation of TONEBP/NFAT5 in response to osmotic stress mediates its rapid nuclear localization. MEF2 is inactivated by phosphorylation in nucleus in response to neurotoxin, thus leading to neuronal apoptosis. APEX1 AP-endodeoxyribonuclease is repressed by phosphorylation, resulting in accumulation of DNA damage and contributing to neuronal death. NOS3 phosphorylation down regulates NOS3-derived nitrite (NO) levels. SRC phosphorylation mediates its ubiquitin-dependent degradation and thus leads to cytoskeletal reorganization. May regulate endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis via the modulation of lamellipodia formation. Involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis by mediating the EFNA1-EPHA4 signaling.

"Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair (PubMed:9374539, PubMed:1317798). The PSMD14 subunit is a metalloprotease that specifically cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains within the complex (PubMed:22909820). Plays a role in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs): acts as a regulator of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by cleaving 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin, thereby promoting retention of JMJD2A/KDM4A on chromatin and restricting TP53BP1 accumulation (PubMed:22909820). Also involved in homologous recombination repair by promoting RAD51 loading (PubMed:22909820). Regulates macroautophagy by ensuring Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport through its deubiquitinating activity on K63-linked ubiquitin chains.

"Component of neuronal acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that function as pentameric, ligand-gated cation channels with high calcium permeability among other activities. nAChRs are excitatory neurotrasnmitter receptors formed by a collection of nAChR subunits known to mediate synaptic transmission in the nervous system and the neuromuscular junction. Each nAchR subunit confers differential attributes to channel properties, including activation, deactivation and desensitization kinetics, pH sensitivity, cation permeability, and binding to allosteric modulators (PubMed:15609996, PubMed:33735609, PubMed:8145738). CHRNA7 forms homopentameric neuronal acetylcholine receptors abundantly expressed in the central nervous system, characterized by fast desensitization and high calcium permeability (PubMed:31560909, PubMed:33735609, PubMed:38382524, PubMed:8145738). Also forms heteropentamers with CHRNB2, mainly expressed in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.

"Serine kinase that plays an essential role in the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway which is activated by multiple stimuli such as inflammatory cytokines, bacterial or viral products, DNA damages or other cellular stresses (PubMed:18626576, PubMed:9244310, PubMed:9252186, PubMed:9346484). Acts as a part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation and phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on serine residues (PubMed:18626576, PubMed:35952808, PubMed:9244310, PubMed:9252186, PubMed:9346484). These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:18626576, PubMed:9244310, PubMed:9252186, PubMed:9346484). In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis (PubMed:18626576, PubMed:9244310, PubMed:9252186, PubMed:9346484). Negatively regulates the pathway by phosphorylating the scaffold protein TAXBP1 and thus promoting the assembly of the A20/TNFAIP3 ubiquitin-editing complex (composed of A20/TNFAIP3, TAX1BP1, and the E3 ligases ITCH and RNF11) (PubMed:21765415). Therefore, CHUK plays a key role in the negative feedback of NF-kappa-B canonical signaling to limit inflammatory gene activation. As part of the non-canonical pathway of NF-kappa-B activation, the MAP3K14-activated CHUK/IKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2/p100 associated with RelB, inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2/p52 and the formation of NF-kappa-B RelB-p52 complexes (PubMed:20501937). In turn, these complexes regulate genes encoding molecules involved in B-cell survival and lymphoid organogenesis. Also participates in the negative feedback of the non-canonical NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by phosphorylating and destabilizing MAP3K14/NIK. Within the nucleus, phosphorylates CREBBP and consequently increases both its transcriptional and histone acetyltransferase activities (PubMed:17434128). Modulates chromatin accessibility at NF-kappa-B-responsive promoters by phosphorylating histones H3 at 'Ser-10' that are subsequently acetylated at 'Lys-14' by CREBBP (PubMed:12789342). Additionally, phosphorylates the CREBBP-interacting protein NCOA3. Also phosphorylates FOXO3 and may regulate this pro-apoptotic transcription factor (PubMed:15084260). Phosphorylates RIPK1 at 'Ser-25' which represses its kinase activity and consequently prevents TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent cell death (By similarity).

Advanced glycosylation end products are nonenzymatically glycosylated proteins which accumulate in vascular tissue in aging and at an accelerated rate in diabetes (PubMed:21565706). These ligands accumulate at inflammatory sites during the pathogenesis of various diseases including diabetes, vascular complications, neurodegenerative disorders and cancers, and RAGE transduces their binding into pro-inflammatory responses. Upon ligand binding, uses TIRAP and MYD88 as adapters to transduce the signal ultimately leading to the induction of inflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8 and TNFalpha through activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:21829704, PubMed:33436632). Interaction with S100A12 on endothelium, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes triggers cellular activation, with generation of key pro-inflammatory mediators (PubMed:19386136).

Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2) (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to nutrients, growth factors or amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:31112131, PubMed:34519269). This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E) (PubMed:24403073, PubMed:29236692). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4 (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692). Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704). Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor (PubMed:20516213). Activates dormant ribosomes by mediating phosphorylation of SERBP1, leading to SERBP1 inactivation and reactivation of translation (PubMed:36691768). In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1 (PubMed:23426360). To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A (By similarity). In the same time, mTORC1 inhibits catabolic pathways: negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser-758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP (PubMed:20537536). Also prevents autophagy by phosphorylating RUBCNL/Pacer under nutrient-rich conditions (PubMed:30704899). Prevents autophagy by mediating phosphorylation of AMBRA1, thereby inhibiting AMBRA1 ability to mediate ubiquitination of ULK1 and interaction between AMBRA1 and PPP2CA (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:25438055). mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor (PubMed:21659604). Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules (PubMed:12231510). The mTORC1 complex is inhibited in response to starvation and amino acid depletion (PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:24403073, PubMed:31695197). The non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB, specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors MITF, TFEB and TFE3 in the presence of nutrients, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:36697823). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670). The mTORC1 complex regulates pyroptosis in macrophages by promoting GSDMD oligomerization (PubMed:34289345). MTOR phosphorylates RPTOR which in turn inhibits mTORC1 (By similarity). As part of the mTORC2 complex, MTOR transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2 is nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). The mTORC2 complex also phosphorylates various proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as FBXW8 and IGF2BP1 (By similarity). May also regulate insulin signaling by acting as a tyrosine protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of IGF1R and INSR; additional evidence are however required to confirm this result in vivo (PubMed:26584640). Regulates osteoclastogenesis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity).

"Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous signaling cascades (PubMed:34556863, PubMed:35672283, PubMed:37991948). The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (PubMed:37991948). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (PubMed:37991948). The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal (PubMed:37991948). Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (PubMed:37991948).

"APOE is an apolipoprotein, a protein associating with lipid particles, that mainly functions in lipoprotein-mediated lipid transport between organs via the plasma and interstitial fluids (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). APOE is a core component of plasma lipoproteins and is involved in their production, conversion and clearance (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). Apolipoproteins are amphipathic molecules that interact both with lipids of the lipoprotein particle core and the aqueous environment of the plasma (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:6860692, PubMed:9395455). As such, APOE associates with chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) but shows a preferential binding to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:6860692). It also binds a wide range of cellular receptors including the LDL receptor/LDLR, the LDL receptor-related proteins LRP1, LRP2 and LRP8 and the very low-density lipoprotein receptor/VLDLR that mediate the cellular uptake of the APOE-containing lipoprotein particles (PubMed:12950167, PubMed:1530612, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:20030366, PubMed:20303980, PubMed:2063194, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:7768901, PubMed:8756331, PubMed:8939961). Finally, APOE also has a heparin-binding activity and binds heparan-sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of cells, a property that supports the capture and the receptor-mediated uptake of APOE-containing lipoproteins by cells (PubMed:23676495, PubMed:7635945, PubMed:9395455, PubMed:9488694). A main function of APOE is to mediate lipoprotein clearance through the uptake of chylomicrons, VLDLs, and HDLs by hepatocytes (PubMed:1911868, PubMed:1917954, PubMed:23676495, PubMed:29516132, PubMed:9395455). APOE is also involved in the biosynthesis by the liver of VLDLs as well as their uptake by peripheral tissues ensuring the delivery of triglycerides and energy storage in muscle, heart and adipose tissues (PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). By participating in the lipoprotein-mediated distribution of lipids among tissues, APOE plays a critical role in plasma and tissues lipid homeostasis (PubMed:1917954, PubMed:2762297, PubMed:29516132). APOE is also involved in two steps of reverse cholesterol transport, the HDLs-mediated transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver, and thereby plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513, PubMed:9395455). First, it is functionally associated with ABCA1 in the biogenesis of HDLs in tissues (PubMed:14754908, PubMed:23620513). Second, it is enriched in circulating HDLs and mediates their uptake by hepatocytes (PubMed:9395455). APOE also plays an important role in lipid transport in the central nervous system, regulating neuron survival and sprouting (PubMed:25173806, PubMed:8939961). APOE is also involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, controlling for instance the survival of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (By similarity).

"Receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates the pleiotropic actions of insulin. Binding of insulin leads to phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including, insulin receptor substrates (IRS1, 2, 3, 4), SHC, GAB1, CBL and other signaling intermediates. Each of these phosphorylated proteins serve as docking proteins for other signaling proteins that contain Src-homology-2 domains (SH2 domain) that specifically recognize different phosphotyrosine residues, including the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and SHP2. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway, which is responsible for most of the metabolic actions of insulin, and the Ras-MAPK pathway, which regulates expression of some genes and cooperates with the PI3K pathway to control cell growth and differentiation. Binding of the SH2 domains of PI3K to phosphotyrosines on IRS1 leads to the activation of PI3K and the generation of phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4, 5)-triphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger, which activates several PIP3-dependent serine/threonine kinases, such as PDPK1 and subsequently AKT/PKB. The net effect of this pathway is to produce a translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the cell membrane to facilitate glucose transport. Moreover, upon insulin stimulation, activated AKT/PKB is responsible for: anti-apoptotic effect of insulin by inducing phosphorylation of BAD; regulates the expression of gluconeogenic and lipogenic enzymes by controlling the activity of the winged helix or forkhead (FOX) class of transcription factors. Another pathway regulated by PI3K-AKT/PKB activation is mTORC1 signaling pathway which regulates cell growth and metabolism and integrates signals from insulin. AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 thereby activating mTORC1 pathway. The Ras/RAF/MAP2K/MAPK pathway is mainly involved in mediating cell growth, survival and cellular differentiation of insulin. Phosphorylated IRS1 recruits GRB2/SOS complex, which triggers the activation of the Ras/RAF/MAP2K/MAPK pathway.

"Transcription factor that binds the cAMP response element (CRE) (consensus: 5'-GTGACGT[AC][AG]-3') and displays two biological functions, as regulator of metabolic and redox processes under normal cellular conditions, and as master transcription factor during integrated stress response (ISR) (PubMed:16682973, PubMed:17684156, PubMed:31023583, PubMed:31444471, PubMed:32132707). Binds to asymmetric CRE's as a heterodimer and to palindromic CRE's as a homodimer (By similarity). Core effector of the ISR, which is required for adaptation to various stress such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, amino acid starvation, mitochondrial stress or oxidative stress (PubMed:31023583, PubMed:32132707). During ISR, ATF4 translation is induced via an alternative ribosome translation re-initiation mechanism in response to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation, and stress-induced ATF4 acts as a master transcription factor of stress-responsive genes in order to promote cell recovery (PubMed:31023583, PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707). Promotes the transcription of genes linked to amino acid sufficiency and resistance to oxidative stress to protect cells against metabolic consequences of ER oxidation (By similarity). Activates the transcription of NLRP1, possibly in concert with other factors in response to ER stress (PubMed:26086088). Activates the transcription of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) in response to amino acid deprivation or ER stress (PubMed:11960987). However, when associated with DDIT3/CHOP, the transcriptional activation of the ASNS gene is inhibited in response to amino acid deprivation (PubMed:18940792). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, mediates programmed cell death by promoting the expression of genes involved in cellular amino acid metabolic processes, mRNA translation and the terminal unfolded protein response (terminal UPR), a cellular response that elicits programmed cell death when ER stress is prolonged and unresolved (By similarity). Activates the expression of COX7A2L/SCAF1 downstream of the EIF2AK3/PERK-mediated unfolded protein response, thereby promoting formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes and increasing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (PubMed:31023583). Together with DDIT3/CHOP, activates the transcription of the IRS-regulator TRIB3 and promotes ER stress-induced neuronal cell death by regulating the expression of BBC3/PUMA in response to ER stress (PubMed:15775988). May cooperate with the UPR transcriptional regulator QRICH1 to regulate ER protein homeostasis which is critical for cell viability in response to ER stress (PubMed:33384352). In the absence of stress, ATF4 translation is at low levels and it is required for normal metabolic processes such as embryonic lens formation, fetal liver hematopoiesis, bone development and synaptic plasticity (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of osteoblast differentiation in response to phosphorylation by RPS6KA3/RSK2: phosphorylation in osteoblasts enhances transactivation activity and promotes expression of osteoblast-specific genes and post-transcriptionally regulates the synthesis of Type I collagen, the main constituent of the bone matrix (PubMed:15109498). Cooperates with FOXO1 in osteoblasts to regulate glucose homeostasis through suppression of beta-cell production and decrease in insulin production (By similarity).

Binds in a circadian time-dependent manner to the cAMP response elements (CRE) in the SLC6A4 and PER2 promoters and periodically activates the transcription of these genes (By similarity). Mainly acts as a transcriptional activator in cellular stress adaptation, but it can also act as a transcriptional repressor: acts as a regulator of synaptic plasticity by repressing transcription, thereby inhibiting induction and maintenance of long-term memory (By similarity).

"NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor present in almost all cell types and is the endpoint of a series of signal transduction events that are initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52 and the heterodimeric p65-p50 complex appears to be most abundant one. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. NF-kappa-B heterodimeric p65-p50 and RelB-p50 complexes are transcriptional activators. The NF-kappa-B p50-p50 homodimer is a transcriptional repressor, but can act as a transcriptional activator when associated with BCL3. NFKB1 appears to have dual functions such as cytoplasmic retention of attached NF-kappa-B proteins by p105 and generation of p50 by a cotranslational processing. The proteasome-mediated process ensures the production of both p50 and p105 and preserves their independent function, although processing of NFKB1/p105 also appears to occur post-translationally. p50 binds to the kappa-B consensus sequence 5'-GGRNNYYCC-3', located in the enhancer region of genes involved in immune response and acute phase reactions.

"Substrate-recognition component of a DCX (DDB1-CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex involved in cell cycle control and autophagy (PubMed:20921139, PubMed:23524951, PubMed:24587252, PubMed:32333458, PubMed:33854232, PubMed:33854235, PubMed:33854239). The DCX(AMBRA1) complex specifically mediates the polyubiquitination of target proteins such as BECN1, CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, ELOC and ULK1 (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:33854232, PubMed:33854235, PubMed:33854239). Acts as an upstream master regulator of the transition from G1 to S cell phase: AMBRA1 specifically recognizes and binds phosphorylated cyclin-D (CCND1, CCND2 and CCND3), leading to cyclin-D ubiquitination by the DCX(AMBRA1) complex and subsequent degradation (PubMed:33854232, PubMed:33854235, PubMed:33854239). By controlling the transition from G1 to S phase and cyclin-D degradation, AMBRA1 acts as a tumor suppressor that promotes genomic integrity during DNA replication and counteracts developmental abnormalities and tumor growth (PubMed:33854232, PubMed:33854235, PubMed:33854239). AMBRA1 also regulates the cell cycle by promoting MYC dephosphorylation and degradation independently of the DCX(AMBRA1) complex: acts via interaction with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PPP2CA), which enhances interaction between PPP2CA and MYC, leading to MYC dephosphorylation and degradation (PubMed:25438055, PubMed:25803737). Acts as a regulator of Cul5-RING (CRL5) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of Elongin-C (ELOC) component of CRL5 complexes (PubMed:25499913, PubMed:30166453). Acts as a key regulator of autophagy by modulating the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex: controls protein turnover during neuronal development, and regulates normal cell survival and proliferation (PubMed:21358617). In normal conditions, AMBRA1 is tethered to the cytoskeleton via interaction with dyneins DYNLL1 and DYNLL2 (PubMed:20921139). Upon autophagy induction, AMBRA1 is released from the cytoskeletal docking site to induce autophagosome nucleation by mediating ubiquitination of proteins involved in autophagy (PubMed:20921139). The DCX(AMBRA1) complex mediates 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of BECN1, increasing the association between BECN1 and PIK3C3 to promote PIK3C3 activity (By similarity). In collaboration with TRAF6, AMBRA1 mediates 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of ULK1 following autophagy induction, promoting ULK1 stability and kinase activity (PubMed:23524951). Also activates ULK1 via interaction with TRIM32: TRIM32 stimulates ULK1 through unanchored 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:31123703). Also acts as an activator of mitophagy via interaction with PRKN and LC3 proteins (MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B or MAP1LC3C); possibly by bringing damaged mitochondria onto autophagosomes (PubMed:21753002, PubMed:25215947). Also activates mitophagy by acting as a cofactor for HUWE1; acts by promoting HUWE1-mediated ubiquitination of MFN2 (PubMed:30217973). AMBRA1 is also involved in regulatory T-cells (Treg) differentiation by promoting FOXO3 dephosphorylation independently of the DCX(AMBRA1) complex: acts via interaction with PPP2CA, which enhances interaction between PPP2CA and FOXO3, leading to FOXO3 dephosphorylation and stabilization (PubMed:30513302).

"Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade.

Extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway (PubMed:28943315). In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK8/JNK1. In turn, MAPK8/JNK1 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN, JDP2 and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity (PubMed:18307971). Phosphorylates the replication licensing factor CDT1, inhibiting the interaction between CDT1 and the histone H4 acetylase HBO1 to replication origins (PubMed:21856198). Loss of this interaction abrogates the acetylation required for replication initiation (PubMed:21856198). Promotes stressed cell apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulatory factors including p53/TP53 and Yes-associates protein YAP1 (PubMed:21364637). In T-cells, MAPK8 and MAPK9 are required for polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells. Contributes to the survival of erythroid cells by phosphorylating the antagonist of cell death BAD upon EPO stimulation (PubMed:21095239).

"Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Essential component of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. With MAP2K4/MKK4, is the one of the only known kinase to directly activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and MAPK10/JNK3. MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 both activate the JNKs by phosphorylation, but they differ in their preference for the phosphorylation site in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. MAP2K4/MKK4 shows preference for phosphorylation of the Tyr residue and MAP2K7/MKK7 for the Thr residue. The monophosphorylation of JNKs on the Thr residue is sufficient to increase JNK activity indicating that MAP2K7/MKK7 is important to trigger JNK activity, while the additional phosphorylation of the Tyr residue by MAP2K4/MKK4 ensures optimal JNK activation. Has a specific role in JNK signal transduction pathway activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. The MKK/JNK signaling pathway is also involved in mitochondrial death signaling pathway, including the release cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis. Part of a non-canonical MAPK signaling pathway, composed of the upstream MAP3K12 kinase and downstream MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1, that enhances the AP-1-mediated transcription of APP in response to APOE (PubMed:28111074).",5609,MAP2K7,No ligand data available,"5Y90, 6YFZ, 6YZ4",Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase 9, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7",O14733,hsa:5609,[]
"IFN-induced dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine-protein kinase that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha) and plays a key role in the innate immune response to viral infection (PubMed:18835251, PubMed:19189853, PubMed:19507191, PubMed:21072047, PubMed:21123651, PubMed:22381929, PubMed:22948139, PubMed:23229543). Inhibits viral replication via the integrated stress response (ISR): EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation in response to viral infection converts EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha in a global protein synthesis inhibitor, resulting to a shutdown of cellular and viral protein synthesis, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activator ATF4 (PubMed:19189853, PubMed:21123651, PubMed:22948139, PubMed:23229543). Exerts its antiviral activity on a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses including hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), measles virus (MV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HHV-1) (PubMed:11836380, PubMed:19189853, PubMed:19840259, PubMed:20171114, PubMed:21710204, PubMed:23115276, PubMed:23399035). Also involved in the regulation of signal transduction, apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation: phosphorylates other substrates including p53/TP53, PPP2R5A, DHX9, ILF3, IRS1 and the HHV-1 viral protein US11 (PubMed:11836380, PubMed:19229320, PubMed:22214662). In addition to serine/threonine-protein kinase activity, also has tyrosine-protein kinase activity and phosphorylates CDK1 at 'Tyr-4' upon DNA damage, facilitating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (PubMed:20395957). Either as an adapter protein and/or via its kinase activity, can regulate various signaling pathways (p38 MAP kinase, NF-kappa-B and insulin signaling pathways) and transcription factors (JUN, STAT1, STAT3, IRF1, ATF3) involved in the expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs (PubMed:22948139, PubMed:23084476, PubMed:23372823). Activates the NF-kappa-B pathway via interaction with IKBKB and TRAF family of proteins and activates the p38 MAP kinase pathway via interaction with MAP2K6 (PubMed:10848580, PubMed:15121867, PubMed:15229216). Can act as both a positive and negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway (ISP) (PubMed:20685959). Negatively regulates ISP by inducing the inhibitory phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) at 'Ser-312' and positively regulates ISP via phosphorylation of PPP2R5A which activates FOXO1, which in turn up-regulates the expression of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) (PubMed:20685959). Can regulate NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and the activation of NLRP3, NLRP1, AIM2 and NLRC4 inflammasomes (PubMed:22801494).

"Dual cyclooxygenase and peroxidase in the biosynthesis pathway of prostanoids, a class of C20 oxylipins mainly derived from arachidonate ((5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoate, AA, C20:4(n-6)), with a particular role in the inflammatory response (PubMed:11939906, PubMed:16373578, PubMed:19540099, PubMed:22942274, PubMed:26859324, PubMed:27226593, PubMed:7592599, PubMed:7947975, PubMed:9261177). The cyclooxygenase activity oxygenates AA to the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), and the peroxidase activity reduces PGG2 to the hydroxy endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor of all 2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes (PubMed:16373578, PubMed:22942274, PubMed:26859324, PubMed:27226593, PubMed:7592599, PubMed:7947975, PubMed:9261177). This complex transformation is initiated by abstraction of hydrogen at carbon 13 (with S-stereochemistry), followed by insertion of molecular O2 to form the endoperoxide bridge between carbon 9 and 11 that defines prostaglandins. The insertion of a second molecule of O2 (bis-oxygenase activity) yields a hydroperoxy group in PGG2 that is then reduced to PGH2 by two electrons (PubMed:16373578, PubMed:22942274, PubMed:26859324, PubMed:27226593, PubMed:7592599, PubMed:7947975, PubMed:9261177). Similarly catalyzes successive cyclooxygenation and peroxidation of dihomo-gamma-linoleate (DGLA, C20:3(n-6)) and eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) to corresponding PGH1 and PGH3, the precursors of 1- and 3-series prostaglandins (PubMed:11939906, PubMed:19540099). In an alternative pathway of prostanoid biosynthesis, converts 2-arachidonoyl lysophopholipids to prostanoid lysophopholipids, which are then hydrolyzed by intracellular phospholipases to release free prostanoids (PubMed:27642067). Metabolizes 2-arachidonoyl glycerol yielding the glyceryl ester of PGH2, a process that can contribute to pain response (PubMed:22942274). Generates lipid mediators from n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) via a lipoxygenase-type mechanism. Oxygenates PUFAs to hydroperoxy compounds and then reduces them to corresponding alcohols (PubMed:11034610, PubMed:11192938, PubMed:9048568, PubMed:9261177). Plays a role in the generation of resolution phase interaction products (resolvins) during both sterile and infectious inflammation (PubMed:12391014). Metabolizes docosahexaenoate (DHA, C22:6(n-3)) to 17R-HDHA, a precursor of the D-series resolvins (RvDs) (PubMed:12391014). As a component of the biosynthetic pathway of E-series resolvins (RvEs), converts eicosapentaenoate (EPA, C20:5(n-3)) primarily to 18S-HEPE that is further metabolized by ALOX5 and LTA4H to generate 18S-RvE1 and 18S-RvE2 (PubMed:21206090). In vascular endothelial cells, converts docosapentaenoate (DPA, C22:5(n-3)) to 13R-HDPA, a precursor for 13-series resolvins (RvTs) shown to activate macrophage phagocytosis during bacterial infection (PubMed:26236990). In activated leukocytes, contributes to oxygenation of hydroxyeicosatetraenoates (HETE) to diHETES (5,15-diHETE and 5,11-diHETE) (PubMed:22068350, PubMed:26282205). Can also use linoleate (LA, (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoate, C18:2(n-6)) as substrate and produce hydroxyoctadecadienoates (HODEs) in a regio- and stereospecific manner, being (9R)-HODE ((9R)-hydroxy-(10E,12Z)-octadecadienoate) and (13S)-HODE ((13S)-hydroxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoate) its major products (By similarity).

"Regulatory subunit of the dimeric UBA3-NAE1 E1 enzyme. E1 activates NEDD8 by first adenylating its C-terminal glycine residue with ATP, thereafter linking this residue to the side chain of the catalytic cysteine, yielding a NEDD8-UBA3 thioester and free AMP. E1 finally transfers NEDD8 to the catalytic cysteine of UBE2M. Necessary for cell cycle progression through the S-M checkpoint. Overexpression of NAE1 causes apoptosis through deregulation of NEDD8 conjugation. The covalent attachment of NEDD8 to target proteins is known as 'neddylation' and the process is involved in the regulation of cell growth, viability and development.",8883,NAE1,No ligand data available,"1TT5, 1YOV, 2NVU",NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 regulatory subunit,"Amyloid-beta precursor protein, NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 catalytic subunit",Q13564,hsa:8883,[]

Mitochondrial calcium homeostasis plays key roles in cellular physiology and regulates ATP production, cytoplasmic calcium signals and activation of cell death pathways (PubMed:21685886, PubMed:21685888, PubMed:22822213, PubMed:22829870, PubMed:22904319, PubMed:23101630, PubMed:23178883, PubMed:23755363, PubMed:24332854, PubMed:24560927, PubMed:26341627, PubMed:29954988, PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32762847).

"Metabolic-stress sensing protein kinase that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha) in response to various stress, such as unfolded protein response (UPR) (PubMed:10026192, PubMed:10677345, PubMed:11907036, PubMed:12086964, PubMed:25925385, PubMed:31023583).

EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation in response to stress converts EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha in a global protein synthesis inhibitor, leading to a global attenuation of cap-dependent translation, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activators ATF4 and QRICH1, and hence allowing ATF4- and QRICH1-mediated reprogramming (PubMed:10026192, PubMed:10677345, PubMed:31023583, PubMed:33384352). The EIF2AK3/PERK-mediated unfolded protein response increases mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by promoting ATF4-mediated expression of COX7A2L/SCAF1, thereby increasing formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes (PubMed:31023583). In contrast to most subcellular compartments, mitochondria are protected from the EIF2AK3/PERK-mediated unfolded protein response due to EIF2AK3/PERK inhibition by ATAD3A at mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites (PubMed:39116259). In addition to EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha, also phosphorylates NFE2L2/NRF2 in response to stress, promoting release of NFE2L2/NRF2 from the BCR(KEAP1) complex, leading to nuclear accumulation and activation of NFE2L2/NRF2 (By similarity).
