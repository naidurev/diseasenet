"Nuclear hormone receptor. The steroid hormones and their receptors are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression and affect cellular proliferation and differentiation in target tissues. Ligand-dependent nuclear transactivation involves either direct homodimer binding to a palindromic estrogen response element (ERE) sequence or association with other DNA-binding transcription factors, such as AP-1/c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF-2, Sp1 and Sp3, to mediate ERE-independent signaling. Ligand binding induces a conformational change allowing subsequent or combinatorial association with multiprotein coactivator complexes through LXXLL motifs of their respective components. Mutual transrepression occurs between the estrogen receptor (ER) and NF-kappa-B in a cell-type specific manner. Decreases NF-kappa-B DNA-binding activity and inhibits NF-kappa-B-mediated transcription from the IL6 promoter and displace RELA/p65 and associated coregulators from the promoter.

"Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Binding of extracellular ligands such as growth factors, cytokines and hormones to their cell-surface receptors activates RAS and this initiates RAF1 activation. RAF1 then further activates the dual-specificity protein kinases MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Both MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2 function specifically in the MAPK/ERK cascade, and catalyze the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in a Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence located in the extracellular signal-regulated kinases MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2, leading to their activation and further transduction of the signal within the MAPK/ERK cascade. Activates BRAF in a KSR1 or KSR2-dependent manner; by binding to KSR1 or KSR2 releases the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between KSR1 or KSR2 protein kinase and N-terminal domains which promotes KSR1 or KSR2-BRAF dimerization and BRAF activation (PubMed:29433126). Depending on the cellular context, this pathway mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation, predominantly through the regulation of transcription, metabolism and cytoskeletal rearrangements. One target of the MAPK/ERK cascade is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), a nuclear receptor that promotes differentiation and apoptosis. MAP2K1/MEK1 has been shown to export PPARG from the nucleus.

"Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade.

Upon mitogenic stimulation, phosphorylation by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) leads to dissociation from the EIF3 complex and activation (PubMed:16286006). The active form then phosphorylates and activates several substrates in the pre-initiation complex, including the EIF2B complex and the cap-binding complex component EIF4B (PubMed:16286006).

"Serine/threonine protein kinase which is a central regulator of cellular metabolism, growth and survival in response to hormones, growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:31112131, PubMed:31601708, PubMed:32561715, PubMed:34519269, PubMed:37751742). MTOR directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:17517883, PubMed:18372248, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:30171069, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:37751742). Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2) (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to nutrients, growth factors or amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:31112131, PubMed:34519269). This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E) (PubMed:24403073, PubMed:29236692). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4 (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692). Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704). Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor (PubMed:20516213). Activates dormant ribosomes by mediating phosphorylation of SERBP1, leading to SERBP1 inactivation and reactivation of translation (PubMed:36691768). In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1 (PubMed:23426360). To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A (By similarity). In the same time, mTORC1 inhibits catabolic pathways: negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser-758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP (PubMed:20537536). Also prevents autophagy by phosphorylating RUBCNL/Pacer under nutrient-rich conditions (PubMed:30704899). Prevents autophagy by mediating phosphorylation of AMBRA1, thereby inhibiting AMBRA1 ability to mediate ubiquitination of ULK1 and interaction between AMBRA1 and PPP2CA (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:25438055). mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor (PubMed:21659604). Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules (PubMed:12231510). The mTORC1 complex is inhibited in response to starvation and amino acid depletion (PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:24403073, PubMed:31695197). The non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB, specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors MITF, TFEB and TFE3 in the presence of nutrients, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:36697823). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670). The mTORC1 complex regulates pyroptosis in macrophages by promoting GSDMD oligomerization (PubMed:34289345). MTOR phosphorylates RPTOR which in turn inhibits mTORC1 (By similarity). As part of the mTORC2 complex, MTOR transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2 is nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). The mTORC2 complex also phosphorylates various proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as FBXW8 and IGF2BP1 (By similarity). May also regulate insulin signaling by acting as a tyrosine protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of IGF1R and INSR; additional evidence are however required to confirm this result in vivo (PubMed:26584640). Regulates osteoclastogenesis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity).

Stimulates glucose transport in bone-derived osteoblastic (PyMS) cells and is effective at much lower concentrations than insulin, not only regarding glycogen and DNA synthesis but also with regard to enhancing glucose uptake. May play a role in synapse maturation (PubMed:21076856, PubMed:24132240). Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of IGF1 is required for sensory perception of smell in the olfactory bulb (By similarity). Acts as a ligand for IGF1R. Binds to the alpha subunit of IGF1R, leading to the activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity which autophosphorylates tyrosine residues in the beta subunit thus initiating a cascade of down-stream signaling events leading to activation of the PI3K-AKT/PKB and the Ras-MAPK pathways.

"Receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates actions of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). Binds IGF1 with high affinity and IGF2 and insulin (INS) with a lower affinity. The activated IGF1R is involved in cell growth and survival control. IGF1R is crucial for tumor transformation and survival of malignant cell. Ligand binding activates the receptor kinase, leading to receptor autophosphorylation, and tyrosines phosphorylation of multiple substrates, that function as signaling adapter proteins including, the insulin-receptor substrates (IRS1/2), Shc and 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway. The result of activating the MAPK pathway is increased cellular proliferation, whereas activating the PI3K pathway inhibits apoptosis and stimulates protein synthesis. Phosphorylated IRS1 can activate the 85 kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (PIK3R1), leading to activation of several downstream substrates, including protein AKT/PKB. AKT phosphorylation, in turn, enhances protein synthesis through mTOR activation and triggers the antiapoptotic effects of IGFIR through phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD. In parallel to PI3K-driven signaling, recruitment of Grb2/SOS by phosphorylated IRS1 or Shc leads to recruitment of Ras and activation of the ras-MAPK pathway. In addition to these two main signaling pathways IGF1R signals also through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (JAK/STAT). Phosphorylation of JAK proteins can lead to phosphorylation/activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. In particular activation of STAT3, may be essential for the transforming activity of IGF1R. The JAK/STAT pathway activates gene transcription and may be responsible for the transforming activity. JNK kinases can also be activated by the IGF1R.

"Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10).

"Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Binding of extracellular ligands such as growth factors, cytokines and hormones to their cell-surface receptors activates RAS and this initiates RAF1 activation. RAF1 then further activates the dual-specificity protein kinases MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Both MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2 function specifically in the MAPK/ERK cascade, and catalyze the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in a Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence located in the extracellular signal-regulated kinases MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2, leading to their activation and further transduction of the signal within the MAPK/ERK cascade. Activates BRAF in a KSR1 or KSR2-dependent manner; by binding to KSR1 or KSR2 releases the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between KSR1 or KSR2 protein kinase and N-terminal domains which promotes KSR1 or KSR2-BRAF dimerization and BRAF activation (PubMed:29433126). Depending on the cellular context, this pathway mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation, predominantly through the regulation of transcription, metabolism and cytoskeletal rearrangements. One target of the MAPK/ERK cascade is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), a nuclear receptor that promotes differentiation and apoptosis. MAP2K1/MEK1 has been shown to export PPARG from the nucleus.

Controls signaling complexes at the T-cell antigen receptor to facilitate the activation, differentiation, and function of T-cells (PubMed:36864087, PubMed:9489702). Mechanistically, engagement of the TCR leads to phosphorylation of the adapter protein LAT, which serves as docking site for GRB2 (PubMed:9489702).

Under conditions of nutrient depletion, the inactive form associates with the EIF3 translation initiation complex (PubMed:16286006). Upon mitogenic stimulation, phosphorylation by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) leads to dissociation from the EIF3 complex and activation (PubMed:16286006). The active form then phosphorylates and activates several substrates in the pre-initiation complex, including the EIF2B complex and the cap-binding complex component EIF4B (PubMed:16286006). Also controls translation initiation by phosphorylating a negative regulator of EIF4A, PDCD4, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis (PubMed:17053147). Promotes initiation of the pioneer round of protein synthesis by phosphorylating POLDIP3/SKAR (PubMed:15341740). In response to IGF1, activates translation elongation by phosphorylating EEF2 kinase (EEF2K), which leads to its inhibition and thus activation of EEF2 (PubMed:11500364). Also plays a role in feedback regulation of mTORC2 by mTORC1 by phosphorylating MAPKAP1/SIN1, MTOR and RICTOR, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC2 and AKT1 signaling (PubMed:15899889, PubMed:19720745, PubMed:19935711, PubMed:19995915).

In response to nutrients, growth factors or amino acids, mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome membrane and promotes protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692, PubMed:31112131, PubMed:34519269). This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E) (PubMed:24403073, PubMed:29236692). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4 (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:29150432, PubMed:29236692). Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704). Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor (PubMed:20516213). Activates dormant ribosomes by mediating phosphorylation of SERBP1, leading to SERBP1 inactivation and reactivation of translation (PubMed:36691768). In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1 (PubMed:23426360). To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A (By similarity). In the same time, mTORC1 inhibits catabolic pathways: negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser-758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1 (PubMed:32561715). Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP (PubMed:20537536). Also prevents autophagy by phosphorylating RUBCNL/Pacer under nutrient-rich conditions (PubMed:30704899). Prevents autophagy by mediating phosphorylation of AMBRA1, thereby inhibiting AMBRA1 ability to mediate ubiquitination of ULK1 and interaction between AMBRA1 and PPP2CA (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:25438055). mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor (PubMed:21659604). Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules (PubMed:12231510). The mTORC1 complex is inhibited in response to starvation and amino acid depletion (PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:24403073, PubMed:31695197). The non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB, specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors MITF, TFEB and TFE3 in the presence of nutrients, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:36697823). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670). The mTORC1 complex regulates pyroptosis in macrophages by promoting GSDMD oligomerization (PubMed:34289345). MTOR phosphorylates RPTOR which in turn inhibits mTORC1 (By similarity). As part of the mTORC2 complex, MTOR transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2 is nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). The mTORC2 complex also phosphorylates various proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as FBXW8 and IGF2BP1 (By similarity). May also regulate insulin signaling by acting as a tyrosine protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of IGF1R and INSR; additional evidence are however required to confirm this result in vivo (PubMed:26584640).

Ligand binding activates the receptor kinase, leading to receptor autophosphorylation, and tyrosines phosphorylation of multiple substrates, that function as signaling adapter proteins including, the insulin-receptor substrates (IRS1/2), Shc and 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway. The result of activating the MAPK pathway is increased cellular proliferation, whereas activating the PI3K pathway inhibits apoptosis and stimulates protein synthesis. Phosphorylated IRS1 can activate the 85 kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (PIK3R1), leading to activation of several downstream substrates, including protein AKT/PKB. AKT phosphorylation, in turn, enhances protein synthesis through mTOR activation and triggers the antiapoptotic effects of IGFIR through phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD. In parallel to PI3K-driven signaling, recruitment of Grb2/SOS by phosphorylated IRS1 or Shc leads to recruitment of Ras and activation of the ras-MAPK pathway. In addition to these two main signaling pathways IGF1R signals also through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (JAK/STAT). Phosphorylation of JAK proteins can lead to phosphorylation/activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. In particular activation of STAT3, may be essential for the transforming activity of IGF1R. The JAK/STAT pathway activates gene transcription and may be responsible for the transforming activity. JNK kinases can also be activated by the IGF1R. IGF1 exerts inhibiting activities on JNK activation via phosphorylation and inhibition of MAP3K5/ASK1, which is able to directly associate with the IGF1R.",3480,IGF1R,Staurosporine (0.2 uM); (-)-Staurosporine (0.21 uM); Tozasertib (0.74 uM); Sunitinib (2.6 uM); (E)-3-(4-Isopropylbenzylidene)indolin-2-one (10.0 uM),"1P4O, 8PYN, 3LW0",Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor,"Insulin receptor substrate 2, Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5, Small ribosomal subunit protein RACK1, Growth factor receptor-bound protein 10, Beta-arrestin-1, Insulin receptor substrate 1, Insulin receptor substrate 4, Integrin alpha-V, Beta-arrestin-2, Integrin beta-4, SHC-transforming protein 1, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Mdm2, Integrin beta-3, Integrin alpha-6, Insulin receptor, Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2, AN1-type zinc finger protein 2B, SH2B adapter protein 1",P08069

"Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 are the 2 MAPKs which play an important role in the MAPK/ERK cascade. They participate also in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Depending on the cellular context, the MAPK/ERK cascade mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation through the regulation of transcription, translation, cytoskeletal rearrangements. The MAPK/ERK cascade also plays a role in initiation and regulation of meiosis, mitosis, and postmitotic functions in differentiated cells by phosphorylating a number of transcription factors. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK cascade is also involved in the regulation of the endosomal dynamics, including lysosome processing and endosome cycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment (PNRC); as well as in the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus during mitosis. The substrates include transcription factors (such as ATF2, BCL6, ELK1, ERF, FOS, HSF4 or SPZ1), cytoskeletal elements (such as CANX, CTTN, GJA1, MAP2, MAPT, PXN, SORBS3 or STMN1), regulators of apoptosis (such as BAD, BTG2, CASP9, DAPK1, IER3, MCL1 or PPARG), regulators of translation (such as EIF4EBP1 and FXR1) and a variety of other signaling-related molecules (like ARHGEF2, DCC, FRS2 or GRB10). Protein kinases (such as RAF1, RPS6KA1/RSK1, RPS6KA3/RSK2, RPS6KA2/RSK3, RPS6KA6/RSK4, SYK, MKNK1/MNK1, MKNK2/MNK2, RPS6KA5/MSK1, RPS6KA4/MSK2, MAPKAPK3 or MAPKAPK5) and phosphatases (such as DUSP1, DUSP4, DUSP6 or DUSP16) are other substrates which enable the propagation the MAPK/ERK signal to additional cytosolic and nuclear targets, thereby extending the specificity of the cascade.

"Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Binding of extracellular ligands such as growth factors, cytokines and hormones to their cell-surface receptors activates RAS and this initiates RAF1 activation. RAF1 then further activates the dual-specificity protein kinases MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2. Both MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2 function specifically in the MAPK/ERK cascade, and catalyze the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in a Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence located in the extracellular signal-regulated kinases MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2, leading to their activation and further transduction of the signal within the MAPK/ERK cascade. Activates BRAF in a KSR1 or KSR2-dependent manner; by binding to KSR1 or KSR2 releases the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between KSR1 or KSR2 protein kinase and N-terminal domains which promotes KSR1 or KSR2-BRAF dimerization and BRAF activation (PubMed:29433126). Depending on the cellular context, this pathway mediates diverse biological functions such as cell growth, adhesion, survival and differentiation, predominantly through the regulation of transcription, metabolism and cytoskeletal rearrangements. One target of the MAPK/ERK cascade is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), a nuclear receptor that promotes differentiation and apoptosis.

Under conditions of nutrient depletion, the inactive form associates with the EIF3 translation initiation complex (PubMed:16286006). Upon mitogenic stimulation, phosphorylation by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) leads to dissociation from the EIF3 complex and activation (PubMed:16286006). The active form then phosphorylates and activates several substrates in the pre-initiation complex, including the EIF2B complex and the cap-binding complex component EIF4B (PubMed:16286006). Also controls translation initiation by phosphorylating a negative regulator of EIF4A, PDCD4, targeting it for ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis (PubMed:17053147).

The non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB, specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors MITF, TFEB and TFE3 in the presence of nutrients, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:36697823). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:24448649, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36608670). The mTORC1 complex regulates pyroptosis in macrophages by promoting GSDMD oligomerization (PubMed:34289345). MTOR phosphorylates RPTOR which in turn inhibits mTORC1 (By similarity). As part of the mTORC2 complex, MTOR transduces signals from growth factors to pathways involved in proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, lipogenesis and anabolic output (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In response to growth factors, mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates AGC protein kinase family members, including AKT (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3), PKC (PRKCA, PRKCB and PRKCE) and SGK1 (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957, PubMed:35926713). In contrast to mTORC1, mTORC2 is nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:15467718). mTORC2 plays a critical role in AKT1 activation by mediating phosphorylation of different sites depending on the context, such as 'Thr-450', 'Ser-473', 'Ser-477' or 'Thr-479', facilitating the phosphorylation of the activation loop of AKT1 on 'Thr-308' by PDPK1/PDK1 which is a prerequisite for full activation (PubMed:15718470, PubMed:21376236, PubMed:24670654, PubMed:29424687, PubMed:29567957). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). The mTORC2 complex also phosphorylates various proteins involved in insulin signaling, such as FBXW8 and IGF2BP1 (By similarity). May also regulate insulin signaling by acting as a tyrosine protein kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of IGF1R and INSR; additional evidence are however required to confirm this result in vivo (PubMed:26584640). Regulates osteoclastogenesis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity).

"Receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates actions of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). Binds IGF1 with high affinity and IGF2 and insulin (INS) with a lower affinity. The activated IGF1R is involved in cell growth and survival control. IGF1R is crucial for tumor transformation and survival of malignant cell. Ligand binding activates the receptor kinase, leading to receptor autophosphorylation, and tyrosines phosphorylation of multiple substrates, that function as signaling adapter proteins including, the insulin-receptor substrates (IRS1/2), Shc and 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway. The result of activating the MAPK pathway is increased cellular proliferation, whereas activating the PI3K pathway inhibits apoptosis and stimulates protein synthesis. Phosphorylated IRS1 can activate the 85 kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (PIK3R1), leading to activation of several downstream substrates, including protein AKT/PKB. AKT phosphorylation, in turn, enhances protein synthesis through mTOR activation and triggers the antiapoptotic effects of IGFIR through phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD. In parallel to PI3K-driven signaling, recruitment of Grb2/SOS by phosphorylated IRS1 or Shc leads to recruitment of Ras and activation of the ras-MAPK pathway. In addition to these two main signaling pathways IGF1R signals also through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (JAK/STAT). Phosphorylation of JAK proteins can lead to phosphorylation/activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. In particular activation of STAT3, may be essential for the transforming activity of IGF1R. The JAK/STAT pathway activates gene transcription and may be responsible for the transforming activity.

"NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor present in almost all cell types and is the endpoint of a series of signal transduction events that are initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. In a non-canonical activation pathway, the MAP3K14-activated CHUK/IKKA homodimer phosphorylates NFKB2/p100 associated with RelB, inducing its proteolytic processing to NFKB2/p52 and the formation of NF-kappa-B RelB-p52 complexes. The NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RelB-p52 complex is a transcriptional activator. The NF-kappa-B p52-p52 homodimer is a transcriptional repressor. NFKB2 appears to have dual functions such as cytoplasmic retention of attached NF-kappa-B proteins by p100 and generation of p52 by a cotranslational processing. The proteasome-mediated process ensures the production of both p52 and p100 and preserves their independent function. p52 binds to the kappa-B consensus sequence 5'-GGRNNYYCC-3', located in the enhancer region of genes involved in immune response and acute phase reactions. p52 and p100 are respectively the minor and major form; the processing of p100 being relatively poor. Isoform p49 is a subunit of the NF-kappa-B protein complex, which stimulates the HIV enhancer in synergy with p65. In concert with RELB, regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer.",4791,NFKB2,"3-Methyl-1-[5-(4-methyl-oxazol-2-yl)-2-thiophen-2-yl-pyrimidin-4-ylamino]-pyrrole-2,5-dione (0.2 uM); ethyl 2-(5-chlorothiophen-2-yl)-4-(3-methyl-2,5-dioxo-2H-pyrrol-1(5H)-ylamino)pyrimidine-5-carboxylate (0.3 uM); ethyl 2-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-4-(3-methyl-2,5-dioxo-2H-pyrrol-1(5H)-ylamino)pyrimidine-5-carboxylate (0.3 uM); ethyl 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(3-methyl-2,5-dioxo-2H-pyrrol-1(5H)-ylamino)pyrimidine-5-carboxylate (0.7 uM); Compound_44289501 (0.7 uM)","1A3Q, 8G8S, 8G8Q",Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B p100 subunit,"Copine-1, Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 14, F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 1A, Protein kinase C theta type",Q00653

"Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as a cell-surface receptor for VEGFC and VEGFD, and plays an essential role in adult lymphangiogenesis and in the development of the vascular network and the cardiovascular system during embryonic development. Promotes proliferation, survival and migration of endothelial cells, and regulates angiogenic sprouting. Signaling by activated FLT4 leads to enhanced production of VEGFC, and to a lesser degree VEGFA, thereby creating a positive feedback loop that enhances FLT4 signaling. Modulates KDR signaling by forming heterodimers. The secreted isoform 3 may function as a decoy receptor for VEGFC and/or VEGFD and play an important role as a negative regulator of VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 or isoform 2 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades; isoform 2 seems to be less efficient in signal transduction, because it has a truncated C-terminus and therefore lacks several phosphorylation sites. Mediates activation of the MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 signaling pathway, of MAPK8 and the JUN signaling pathway, and of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Phosphorylates SHC1. Mediates phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

"Protein, which is both involved in DNA repair and protein ubiquitination, as part of the UV-DDB complex and DCX (DDB1-CUL4-X-box) complexes, respectively (PubMed:10882109, PubMed:11278856, PubMed:11705987, PubMed:12732143, PubMed:15882621, PubMed:16473935, PubMed:18593899, PubMed:32789493, PubMed:9892649). Core component of the UV-DDB complex (UV-damaged DNA-binding protein complex), a complex that recognizes UV-induced DNA damage and recruit proteins of the nucleotide excision repair pathway (the NER pathway) to initiate DNA repair (PubMed:10882109, PubMed:11278856, PubMed:11705987, PubMed:12944386, PubMed:14751237, PubMed:16260596, PubMed:32789493). The UV-DDB complex preferentially binds to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP), apurinic sites and short mismatches (PubMed:10882109, PubMed:11278856, PubMed:11705987, PubMed:12944386, PubMed:16260596). Also functions as the substrate recognition module for the DCX (DDB2-CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex DDB2-CUL4-ROC1 (also known as CUL4-DDB-ROC1 and CUL4-DDB-RBX1) (PubMed:12732143, PubMed:15882621, PubMed:16473935, PubMed:18593899, PubMed:26572825). The DDB2-CUL4-ROC1 complex may ubiquitinate histone H2A, histone H3 and histone H4 at sites of UV-induced DNA damage (PubMed:16473935, PubMed:16678110). The ubiquitination of histones may facilitate their removal from the nucleosome and promote subsequent DNA repair (PubMed:16473935, PubMed:16678110). The DDB2-CUL4-ROC1 complex also ubiquitinates XPC, which may enhance DNA-binding by XPC and promote NER (PubMed:15882621). The DDB2-CUL4-ROC1 complex also ubiquitinates KAT7/HBO1 in response to DNA damage, leading to its degradation: recognizes KAT7/HBO1 following phosphorylation by ATR (PubMed:26572825).",1643,DDB2,No ligand data available,"3I7L, 4E54, 4E5Z",DNA damage-binding protein 2,"Tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1, Calcineurin-binding protein cabin-1, COP9 signalosome complex subunit 6",Q92466

In response to DSBs, phosphorylation by ATM promotes interaction with RIF1 and dissociation from NUDT16L1/TIRR, leading to recruitment to DSBs sites (PubMed:28241136). Recruited to DSBs sites by recognizing and binding histone H2A monoubiquitinated at 'Lys-15' (H2AK15Ub) and histone H4 dimethylated at 'Lys-20' (H4K20me2), two histone marks that are present at DSBs sites (PubMed:17190600, PubMed:23760478, PubMed:27153538, PubMed:28241136). Required for immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (CSR) during antibody genesis, a process that involves the generation of DNA DSBs (PubMed:23345425). Participates in the repair and the orientation of the broken DNA ends during CSR (By similarity). In contrast, it is not required for classic NHEJ and V(D)J recombination (By similarity).
